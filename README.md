# Endpoint Tools

An opinionated but customizable tool for designing, enforcing and communicating
endpoints.

## Features

This repo contains numerous tools to make it easier to design and type-check
endpoints:

- Methods for validating and preparing endpoints
- Types for all Rest methods, making it a breeze to design and communicate
  endpoints.
- Flavor types for common JS/TS primitives, allowing on-the-spot assignment.
  while preventing cross-assignment of unrelated primitive values
- Mixins for common record objects, such as requestId.
- Helpers such as Flavor and Brand for managing endpoint related types and
  interfaces on the frond and backend.
